# AI Capital Finder using Ollama API

This is a beginner-friendly AI project that uses the Ollama API with the LLaMA 3.2 model to generate answers to country-related questions. 
Specifically, this script takes a country's name and asks the AI to identify its capital city.

### Features
- Simple Python script to interact with a language model.
- Demonstrates how to use the ollama Python module.
- Dynamically constructs prompts using variables.

## How It Works
- The script sets a country name (India) as input.
- It uses the ollama.generate() function to ask:
- "Which is the capital of India?"
- The LLaMA model processes the question and returns a natural language response.
- The answer is printed to the console.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Ollama Python SDK
- LLaMA 3.2 language model
