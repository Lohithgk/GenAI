## Simple Agent ##
A minimalistic AI agent built using the Agno framework and powered by LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama. 
This agent takes a single prompt as input and returns a response generated by the model—no tools, no memory, just pure prompt-to-response interaction.

## Features ##
Single-prompt interaction: Stateless design for simplicity and clarity.
LLaMA 3.2: Uses Meta’s LLaMA 3.2 model for high-quality language generation.
Agno Framework: Built on Agno, a Python framework for modular multi-agent systems.
Ollama Integration: Seamless local model execution using Ollama.
